README
  Erebus is my opinionated NixOS, Home Manager, and nix-darwin configuration,
  built upon flake-parts.

FEATURES
  - Reusable module system for programs not present in nixpkgs, home-manager,
    or chaotic-nyx.
  - Wayland-first configuration.
  - Cohesive styling (courtsey of Stylix, nix-cursors, and more!).
  - Useful packages for a range of systems.
  - Support for multiple architectures.

TODO
  - A "guest mode": a seperate login for when people want to borrow my computer
  - Ephemeral root and home.
  - Declarative partitions with disko, featuring BTRFS and LUKS encryption.

INSTALLATION
  I wouldn't recommend using the system configurations as they are tailored
  to my needs, however feel free to import the repository as an input in
  *your* flake to use its packages!
