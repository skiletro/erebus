README
  Erebus is my opinionated NixOS, Home Manager, and nix-darwin configuration, built upon flake-parts.

FEATURES
  - Reusable module system for programs not present in nixpkgs, home-manager, or chaotic-nyx.
  - Wayland-first configuration.
  - Cohesive styling (courtsey of Stylix, nix-cursors, and more!).
  - Useful packages for a range of systems.
  - Support for multiple architectures.

TODO
  This flake is currently not in use for my primary system (eris).
  The following is what I need to do before I can make the swap, in no particular order.

  - Game Configs (CS2, VRChat, etc)
  - Add "Fix Steam Icons" to the Steam module. (https://github.com/beedywool/Gnome-Steam-Shortcut-Fixer/)
  - Proton Drive rclone service
  - KDE Plasma
  - GSR-UI
  - Other gaming packages and options (https://github.com/skiletro/nixfiles/blob/master/modules/pc/gaming/misc.nix)
  - Chromium (or chromium-like browser, this is for web dev testing in mutliple engines)
  - LACT (AMD GPU Overclocking)
  - Localsend (Open source file sending, should also try and figure out if an Airdrop-compatible solution is avail.)
  - Vial, or VIA.
  - Secrets (most likely using sops-nix, needed for GitHub Access Token, Rclone private key, system user password)

  And the following is some "nice to haves"
  - Guest mode (seperate login for when people are over and want to use my computer)
  - Ephemeral root and home, alongside impermanence
  - Btrfs with drive compression (for steam games)

INSTALLATION
  I wouldn't recommend using the system configurations as they are tailored to my needs, however feel free to import
  the repository as an input in *your* flake to use its packages!
